# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds Google OAuth login functionality to AuraFlow, providing users with a seamless one-click authentication option. Google login will reduce friction in the user onboarding process, potentially increasing conversion rates while leveraging Google's trusted authentication infrastructure. The implementation will extend the existing JWT-based authentication system to support social login alongside the current email/password method.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Google OAuth Integration Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure Google OAuth properly so that users can authenticate using their Google accounts securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up Google OAuth THEN the system SHALL create a Google Cloud Console project with OAuth 2.0 credentials
2. WHEN configuring OAuth credentials THEN the system SHALL set up authorized domains for both mobile and web platforms
3. WHEN storing OAuth configuration THEN the system SHALL securely manage client ID and client secret in environment variables
4. WHEN initializing the application THEN the system SHALL configure Google Sign-In SDK for both React Native and web platforms
5. IF OAuth configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback to email/password login

### Requirement 2: Backend Google Authentication Service

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to securely verify my Google identity so that I can trust the authentication process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a Google ID token THEN the system SHALL verify the token with Google's tokeninfo endpoint
2. WHEN verifying Google tokens THEN the system SHALL validate token signature, expiration, and audience claims
3. WHEN a Google user logs in for the first time THEN the system SHALL create a new user account with Google profile information
4. WHEN an existing user logs in with Google THEN the system SHALL link the Google account to their existing profile if email matches
5. IF Google token verification fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses and log security events

### Requirement 3: User Account Management with Google Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want my Google account information to be properly integrated so that I have a seamless experience across login methods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers via Google THEN the system SHALL create a user profile with name, email, and avatar from Google
2. WHEN a Google user is created THEN the system SHALL set the password field as optional since social login doesn't require it
3. WHEN a user has both email/password and Google login THEN the system SHALL allow authentication via either method
4. WHEN displaying user profile THEN the system SHALL show Google avatar if available, with fallback to default avatar
5. IF a user wants to unlink Google account THEN the system SHALL provide account management options (future consideration)

### Requirement 4: Mobile Google Sign-In Implementation

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to sign in with Google using native mobile flows so that I have the best possible user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a mobile user taps "Sign in with Google" THEN the system SHALL launch the native Google Sign-In flow
2. WHEN Google Sign-In completes successfully THEN the system SHALL receive the ID token and send it to the backend
3. WHEN the backend validates the token THEN the system SHALL receive JWT tokens and store them securely
4. WHEN Google Sign-In is available THEN the system SHALL display the Google sign-in button prominently on auth screens
5. IF Google Sign-In fails THEN the system SHALL show appropriate error messages and allow fallback to email/password

### Requirement 5: Web Google Sign-In Implementation

**User Story:** As a web user, I want to sign in with Google using the web OAuth flow so that I can quickly access my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a web user clicks "Sign in with Google" THEN the system SHALL initiate Google OAuth 2.0 authorization flow
2. WHEN Google authorization completes THEN the system SHALL receive the authorization code and exchange it for tokens
3. WHEN tokens are received THEN the system SHALL send the ID token to the backend for verification
4. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the main application with JWT tokens
5. IF OAuth flow is cancelled or fails THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and provide retry options

### Requirement 6: Security and Privacy Considerations

**User Story:** As a user, I want my Google authentication to be secure and respect my privacy so that I can trust the application with my data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting Google OAuth scopes THEN the system SHALL only request necessary permissions (profile, email)
2. WHEN storing Google user data THEN the system SHALL comply with Google's API Terms of Service and privacy requirements
3. WHEN handling authentication errors THEN the system SHALL not expose sensitive information in error messages
4. WHEN logging authentication events THEN the system SHALL log security-relevant events without exposing tokens
5. IF Google revokes access THEN the system SHALL handle revocation gracefully and prompt for re-authentication

### Requirement 7: Database Schema Updates

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the database to support Google authentication data so that user accounts can be properly managed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating the users table THEN the system SHALL add google_id column for storing Google user identifier
2. WHEN storing user profiles THEN the system SHALL add name and avatar_url columns for Google profile data
3. WHEN creating users via Google THEN the system SHALL make password_hash column optional
4. WHEN querying users THEN the system SHALL support finding users by either email or google_id
5. IF database migration fails THEN the system SHALL provide rollback capabilities and error handling

### Requirement 8: User Experience and Interface Updates

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear and intuitive Google sign-in options so that I can easily choose my preferred authentication method.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing login screens THEN the system SHALL display Google sign-in button with official Google branding
2. WHEN showing authentication options THEN the system SHALL present Google login as equally prominent to email/password
3. WHEN a user is signed in via Google THEN the system SHALL display their Google profile information appropriately
4. WHEN switching between auth methods THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual feedback and loading states
5. IF Google sign-in is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully hide the option and show only email/password

### Requirement 9: Error Handling and Fallback Mechanisms

**User Story:** As a user, I want reliable authentication even if Google services are temporarily unavailable so that I can always access my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Google services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL detect the outage and disable Google sign-in temporarily
2. WHEN Google authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and suggest alternative login methods
3. WHEN network connectivity is poor THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate timeouts and retry mechanisms
4. WHEN Google API rate limits are hit THEN the system SHALL handle rate limiting gracefully with exponential backoff
5. IF critical Google authentication errors occur THEN the system SHALL log errors for monitoring and alerting

### Requirement 10: Testing and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing for Google authentication so that the feature is reliable and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing Google auth THEN the system SHALL include unit tests for token verification and user creation
2. WHEN testing authentication flows THEN the system SHALL create integration tests for both mobile and web platforms
3. WHEN validating security THEN the system SHALL test error scenarios and edge cases
4. WHEN testing user experience THEN the system SHALL verify proper handling of success and failure states
5. IF tests fail THEN the system SHALL prevent deployment until all authentication tests pass
