## Priority Notes:
- **CRITICAL**: Start with Phase 1 tasks (21-24) - these unblock everything else
- **Phase 1 must be completed first** - without it, the app runs only on mock data
- **Phase 2**: Core user-facing features that make the app compelling
- **Phase 3**: Infrastructure for scale and performance
- **Phase 4**: Polish, security, and comprehensive testing

**Current Status**: Tasks 1-11.2 completed (75% of MVP), Phase 1 critical for real functionality
