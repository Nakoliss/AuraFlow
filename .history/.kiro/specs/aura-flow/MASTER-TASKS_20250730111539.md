   - These tasks unblock all real functionality

### **HIGH PRIORITY (DO NEXT):**
2. **Tasks 29-31**: Infrastructure and deployment setup
3. **Tasks 32-35**: Core features completion
4. **Tasks 36-38**: Performance and analytics

### **MEDIUM PRIORITY (DO AFTER CORE):**
5. **Tasks 39-40**: Quality and security enhancements
6. **Tasks 41-42**: Testing and CI/CD automation

### **FINAL PHASE (LAUNCH PREP):**
7. **Tasks 43-44**: Integration testing and production launch

## CONTEXT FOR AI AGENTS:

- **Business Model**: Freemium app with Premium Core ($4.99/mo) and Voice Pack (+$0.99/mo)
- **Architecture**: Turbo monorepo, Cloudflare Workers, Supabase PostgreSQL + pgvector
- **Design System**: Claymorphism with Clay* prefixed components
- **Tech Stack**: TypeScript, Expo React Native, Astro, OpenAI/Anthropic, ElevenLabs TTS
- **Performance Target**: <150ms perceived latency, 90-day deduplication, semantic caching
- **Success Metrics**: 5% premium conversion, D1/D7/D30 retention, ARPU optimization

**Current Status**: Phase 0 critical foundation work is needed. Tasks 1-24 from previous task lists have been completed (75% of MVP), but Phase 0 tasks are blocking real functionality.
